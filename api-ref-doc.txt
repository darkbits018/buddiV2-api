What was your very first impression of the platform when you opened it? Did it feel intimidating, structured, or exciting?

You started with Linux Ubuntu and CLI Bash. Why start there instead of a regular Windows environment?
windows is good but, linux ubuntu is opensource offers good support for devs, and the terminal is bash in windows it needs to be installes separately, i belive starting with linux and cli is ideal for any upcoming programmer. and lastly its cool

Did you feel Linux gave you an edge or made learning smoother? (For example: Was it faster, more efficient, or just more "coder-like"?)
yes i used very old machine installing linux in it was a gamechanger while it was faster it was also coder-like

Did using the command line feel natural at first, or did it take you time to get comfortable?
it did take me some time, but eventually it became second nature, there are lots of commands but you only need to remeber a few, if dont remember any command you can just google it  or ask chat gpt , donthesitate to google it or chatgpt it

just go to odin project start from foundation youll get the hang of it after git section you can also dive into free codecamp lessons no free code camp even has The Odin Project - freeCodeCamp Remix (Beta)
freeCodeCamp has expanded upon the open source curriculum to make it run interactively in the browser, with tests to evaluate your code and ensure you've understood key concepts.

Looking back, what skills or habits (like debugging, writing clean code, or problem-solving) did you develop thanks to The Odin Project?
it built the foundation

Why do you believe The Odin Project is such a good choice for beginners compared to other resources?
