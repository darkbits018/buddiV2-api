Setting the Stage
so here is how it went:
we were in our 2nd year maybe,


Which hackathon or event were you attending? Where and when did it happen?
It was a state level Hackathon conducted in anearby college, in 2022 maybe it was named sentinal hack 2.0

What was the problem or challenge you were trying to solve? (Describe briefly the hackathon problem statement or task.
problem statement : In traffic filled roads Rescue Vehicle's Siren sound spreads out and its confusing for commuters to make way, as they wont know from which direction the Rescue Vehicle is approaching and where its heading.
motive : To install a low cost device in heavy traffic junctions on traffic lights to make way in critical situations for Fire Fighters and Ambulances
Aim : to develop a system
- Informs commuters from where the Rescue Vehicle is coming
- To where the Rescue vehicle  is heading
- Provide a way to clear traffic
working theory :
- A navigation app for Rescue Vehicle driver to know the best possible route to the destination
- A hardware system installed on the traffic signals to let the commuters know the direction Rescue Vehicle is heading towards
- The app would send signals to the system regarding the passage of Rescue Vehicle
